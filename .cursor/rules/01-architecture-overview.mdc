# MCP-Visio Architecture Overview

This project implements a Microsoft Connected Platform (MCP) server for Visio integration. The architecture consists of:

- [src/services/mcp_service.py](mdc:src/services/mcp_service.py): Handles JSON-RPC message processing for MCP
- [src/services/visio_service.py](mdc:src/services/visio_service.py): Provides methods for interacting with Visio
- [visio_api.py](mdc:visio_api.py): FastAPI definitions for the REST endpoints
- [host_visio_relay.py](mdc:host_visio_relay.py): Windows host relay service that directly interacts with Visio

The system uses a client-server architecture where the MCP service runs in a container and communicates with Visio via the relay service running on the Windows host.
