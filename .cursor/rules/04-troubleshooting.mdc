# Troubleshooting MCP-Visio Connection

If you encounter connection issues between the MCP service and Visio:

1. **Check if Visio is running**:
   - The relay service attempts to connect to Visio on startup
   - Verify Visio is installed and accessible on the host

2. **Verify the relay service**:
   - Make sure the relay service is running: `host_visio_relay.py`
   - Check the health endpoint: `http://localhost:8051/health`

3. **Stencil access issues**:
   - Use `get_available_masters` to see what stencils are currently accessible
   - Common fallbacks are implemented in [host_visio_relay.py](mdc:host_visio_relay.py)

4. **Error handling**:
   - Most operations have fallback mechanisms for handling common errors
   - Check logs in `visio_relay.log` for detailed error information

Key files for diagnostics:
- [host_visio_relay.py](mdc:host_visio_relay.py) - Contains error handling and fallback logic
- [src/services/visio_service.py](mdc:src/services/visio_service.py) - Manages connection to the relay
